uri-template is an implementation of the URI Template proposed
standard draft version 01
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-01) as a reader
macro, used for both template interpolation and URI destructuring.

Although uri-template does not implement the operators introduced in
the 02 and later drafts of the URI Template standard, it does allow
arbitrary Lisp expressions in template placeholders, which gives
simpler and more powerful templates.
